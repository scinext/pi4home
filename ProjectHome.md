On this project I will collect ingredients to make your home part of the internet of things and services.

Prerequisites for these things are:

  * [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/) hardware
  * The [Raspbian](http://www.raspbian.org/) Linux distribution
  * Various breakout boards and IC's for sensors, digital/analog I/O, actors, ...
  * Famous [WebIOPi](http://code.google.com/p/webiopi/) web remote framework  provided by Eric PTAK
  * Android based Smartphones
  * Web Browers on all kind of devices

And you may be also able to switch lights on and off with your Smartphone ... from abroad.

Software can be found in the Downloads and Source parts (currently nothing so far ...).

Documentation is provided inside the project

Curious why I'm doing this? Read this [book](http://solutions.forrester.com/disruption) and you can follow my motivation. I think it's the right time now to finish home automation proprietary solutions and foster open source IP and Web technology based disruption - NOW.
