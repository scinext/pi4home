# Device TSL4531 (TSL45311, TSL45313, TSL45315, TSL45317) #
## _DESCRIPTION_ ##

---

The TSL4531 is a light-to-digital converter that transforms light intensity to a digital signal output
capable of direct I2C interface.

This description is valid for driver v1.0

### Implemented features/functions ###
  * Read luminosity value in units of lux
  * Wakeup device and send it back to sleep
  * Set integration time

### (Currently) NOT implemented features/functions ###
  * Automatic gain and timing control to avoid sensor saturation (maybe next release)
  * One ADC cycle setting (maybe next+ release)
  * Powersave skip setting (maybe next+ release)

### (Presumably) NEVER implemented features/functions ###
  * Reading of ID register (very useless information)

## _REST API_ ##

---

### Automatic REST mapping ###
This driver implements the standard mapping for the Luminosity devices class.
| **HTTP/CoAP method** | **URL path** | **Result type** | **Description** |
|:---------------------|:-------------|:----------------|:----------------|
| GET                  | /device/{configname}/sensor/luminosity/lx | text/plain      | Get brightness in units of lux |

### REST examples ###
```
GET http://host_or_ip:8000/devices/sensor/mytsl4531/luminosity/lx 
```

## _CONFIG_ ##

---

### Config options ###
| **Parameter** | **Values** | **Remarks** |
|:--------------|:-----------|:------------|
| time:         | **400**, 200, 100 | Integration time in ms |

_Remark: Default values are in **bold**_

_Remark 2: You could give a slave parameter, but chips have slave address fixed to 0x39 for TSL45311/TSL45313 and 0x29 for TSL45315/TSL45317 so this parameter is redundant and should be avoided.
### Config examples ###
```
mytsl4531   = TSL4531
mytsl4531_2 = TSL45311 time:100
mytsl4531_3 = TSL45315 time:200
```_

The chip comes in 4 variants (TSL45311, TSL45313, TSL45315, TSL45317), generic class TSL4531 defaults to TSL45315 as this is the one used on the breakout board that you can buy for now.

### Device instance API ###
| **Method** | **Return value** | **Description** | **Remarks** |
|:-----------|:-----------------|:----------------|:------------|
| getLux()   | float            | Read luminosity |
| wake()     | n/a              | Wakeup the device | Device is powered down after power on reset |
| sleep()    | n/a              | Set the device to sleep mode |
| setTime(integer) | n/a              | Set integration time | Valid values are 400, 200, 100 |
| getTime()  | integer          | Get integration time |

### API examples ###
```
def myExample()
    aTSL4531 = deviceInstance("mytsl4531")
    aTSL4531.setTime(200)
    lux = aTSL4531.getLux()
    print("Lux: %.2f" % (lux))
```
